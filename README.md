# Project Management API

This is a Django-based REST API for managing projects and tasks. It allows users to register, create projects, assign tasks, and manage access control with roles.

## Features

- User authentication with JWT (Admins & Members)
- Admins can create, update, and delete projects & tasks
- Members can only update task statuses
- API endpoints for users, projects, and tasks

## Technologies Used

- Django 5.1.6
- Django REST Framework
- Simple JWT for authentication
- Django Jazzmin for admin panel

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply migrations:
